This repository contains summaries of NLP-related research papers I've read. Each summary highlights the core problem, methodology, results, and potential research gaps that could inspire future exploration (if any).

The summaries are written in my own words to help me internalize key insights and think critically about each work. It's a way to stay engaged and build deeper understanding as I grow in the field. 

Feel free to open an issue if you’d like to suggest a paper you think I should read next — especially if it's related to NLP, LLMs, or AI in education and critical thinking. I’d really appreciate it!
